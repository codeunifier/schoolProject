        <div class="topic-info">Build a JSON object that is MUCH more than { name: "Bob" }. 
            Add attributes to a JSON object. It should include arrays, arrays of JSON 
            sub-objects, numbers and strings.</div>
        <div class="explanation">A while ago I built a website for the game Dungeons &
            Dragons that would help users create characters. I wasn't as experienced a 
            programmer back then, so I did all of my coding and developing of this 
            website offline, without a server or anything. Instead of using a database, 
            I built everything with JSON objects. Below is an example taken from this 
            JSON code for the Barbarian class.
        </div>
        <pre id="dndFile">

        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">While this was a pretty horrible and time-consuming
            way of making this website, it offers a pretty good example of how JSON 
            objects can be made and used. As you can see in the sample code above, a 
            JSON object is basically a glorified JavaScript object (or maybe it's the 
            other way around?). The biggest difference is that each "attribute" in the 
            JSON object is defined in quotes. The values given to each attribute do not
            always need to be in quotes, like numbers.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Let's user a simpler example to explain further. We can
            widdle the Barbarian class down to just a level and a couple attacks. And let's
            add a Wizard class with a couple attacks as well.
        </div>
        <pre id="simpleExample">

        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">You'll notice that this JSON object begins and ends 
            with square brackets rather than curly braces, since this object is now an 
            array of two JSON sub-objects, similar to the structure of each class's attacks.
            Creating JSON objects like this makes it possible to essentially store 
            information in a structure that makes sense to us and to its purpose. it's 
            important to recognize that functions cannot be defined within JSON objects. JSON
            is purely a data definition language, not an actual programming langugage that 
            ever gets compiled.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">That being said, there are a few set data types that are
            supported in JSON objects. In the example above, you'll see strings, numbers, 
            boolean values, objects, and arrays all being set as values.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Interacting with JSON objects is pretty straightforward 
            once you know the syntax in the language you're working with. Because the nature
            of objects in JavaScript is so similar to JSON objects, it's one of the easiest
            languages to use in demonstrating JSON objects. We can use JavaScript to list out
            our two classes and their respective attacks. We'll use a function called readFile
            that will read the json file and call the callback function providing the text
            in that file.
        </div>
        <pre>
        //as long as the text is in proper JSON format, the file can be .json or .txt
        readFile("simple-example.json", function (text) {

            //"text" is a string containing the contents of the file


            //parse the text into a JSON object
            var jsonObj = JSON.parse(text);


            //attributes of the object can be accessed in different ways, like regular JavaScript objects
            console.log(jsonObj[0].ClassName);      //prints "Barbarian"
            console.log(jsonObj[1]["ClassName"]);   //prints "Wizard"


            //note that capitalization matters, so make sure to match what is in the JSON file
            console.log(jsonObj[0].classname);      //prints "undefined"


            //let's set the classes to their own objects in JavaScript
            var barbarian = jsonObj[0];
            var wizard = jsonObj[1];


            //printing their attacks can be a bit tricky, since we have to delve into the JSON object
            for (var i = 0; i < barbarian.Attacks.length; i++) {
                console.log(barbarian.Attacks[i].AttackName);   //prints "Punch" and "Axe";
            }
        });
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">It is also possible to write to a JSON file in our code from a 
            JavaScript object. Let's add a Druid class into our JSON object. We'll assume that 
            we've already built a function to read the original file and parse it into an object.
        </div>
        <pre>
        //get the original JSON object
        var jsonObj = getJSONFromFile();


        //add the new Druid class
        jsonObj.push({
            "ClassName": "Druid",
            "Level": 1,
            "IsAlive": true,
            "Attacks": [
                {
                    "AttackName": "Transform",
                    "Damage": null
                },
                {
                    "AttackName": "Bear Claw",
                    "Damage": 6
                }
            ]
        });


        //to write this back into the JSON file, we have to convert the JSON object into a string
        var stringified = JSON.strigify(jsonObj);


        console.log(stringified);   //prints the entire object as a single string


        //call function to write to file
        writeToFile(stringified);
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">It's important to note that once the JSON object has been parsed 
            into a JavaScript object, it can be modified any way a JavaScript object could be, so 
            it's good practice to have some sort of constructor function within your code when adding
            to a JSON object to ensure the model stays consistent.
