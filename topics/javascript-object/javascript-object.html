            <div class="topic-info">Show me work where you create an 
                object that contains data and functions. Use 'new' to 
                create several types of that object, modify the object 
                attributes and call the associated functions</div>
            <div class="explanation">One of the most appealing qualities
                of JavaScript is its flexibility with objects and data
                types. An object in JavaScript is essentially the same
                thing as a class in most other languages. An object
                can contain other objects and functions.

            <div class="explanation">Look at the code below. Here, we
                initialize a new object in JavaScript and give it a 
                property and a method.
            </div>
            <pre>
            
            </pre>
            
            <button onclick="myFunction()">Load Doc</button>
