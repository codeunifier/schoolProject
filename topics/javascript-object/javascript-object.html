            <h1>Code Topic: JavaScript Objects</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="topic-info">Show me work where you create an 
            object that contains data and functions. Use 'new' to 
            create several types of that object, modify the object 
            attributes and call the associated functions</div>
        <div class="explanation">One of the most appealing qualities
            of JavaScript is its flexibility with objects and data
            types. An object in JavaScript is essentially the same
            thing as a class in most other languages. An object
            can contain other objects and functions.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Look at the code below. Here, we
            initialize a new object in JavaScript and give it a 
            property and a method.
        </div>
        <pre>
            function myFunction() {
                var object = {}; //using curly brackets initializes a new object
            
                object.something = "good";
                object.func = function () {
                    console.log("I'm feeling " + this.something);
                }
            
                object.func();
            }
        </pre>
        <button onclick="myFunction()">My Function</button>
        <span id="feeling"></span>
        <div class="explanation">As you can see, an object is able to
            reference its own properties.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Functions in JavaScript can act
            as initializers for classes. The code sample below 
            demonstrates an intializer and a couple instances of 
            the "class."
        </div>
        <pre>
            function Dog(breed, color, owner) {
                this.breed = breed;
                this.color = color;
                this.owner = owner;
            }
            
            function createDogs() {
                var yourDog = new Dog("beagle", "brown/white", "you");
                var myDog = new Dog("german shepherd", "brown/black", "me");
            
                console.log(yourDog.breed);
                console.log(myDog.breed);
            }
        </pre>
        <button onclick="createDogs()">Create Dogs</button>
        <span id="dogs"></span>
        <div class="explanation">We can add a couple methods to our Dog 
            class to give it a bit more life.
        </div>
        <pre>
            function Dog(breed, color, owner) {
                this.breed = breed;
                this.color = color;
                this.owner = owner;
                this.bark = function () {
                    console.log("Woof!");
                }
            }
            
            function createDogs() {
                var yourDog = new Dog("beagle", "brown/white", "you");
                var myDog = new Dog("german shepherd", "brown/black", "me");
