            <h1>Code Topic: CSS Transitions</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="topic-info">Designing, Defining, and Triggering CSS3 Transitions without Custom Libraries</div>
        <div class="explanation">Similar to <a href="/topics/js-ani/js-ani.html">Transitions with JavaScript</a>, the 
            transitions demonstated here will be altering the CSS styles of elements on the DOM, but here we will 
            only be using CSS to make these transitions.</div>
        <div class="explanation">Using the same demonstration as before, we can observe a mouseover event by using 
            the :hover attribute in our CSS. While it isn't possible to toggle classes with CSS alone, we can still 
            modify CSS on events like this and add some transition animation to it.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">In the previous demonstration, the circle tried fleeing the mouse by changing 
            directions, but this time it got a bit smarter with avoiding the mouse.
        </div>
        <div id="demo1" class="demo">
            <div id="circle" class="circle-demo"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Below is the CSS added to make this transition possible. The transition will shrink 
            the circle to 1px in size over 3 seconds, as long as the cursor stays over the circle.
        </div>
        <pre>
    #circle:hover {
        background-color: red;
        width: 1px;
        height: 1px;
        transition: width 3s, height 3s;
    }
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">That's enough with circles. Let's leave them alone for a while.</div>
        <div class="explanation">The next demonstration will show off some of the other properties 
            of transitions. 
        </div>
        <div class="explanation"><b>transition-delay</b></div>
        <div class="explanation">This is our square. He takes some time to get used to the mouse. But he'll warm up to it.</div>
        <div id="demo2" class="demo">
            <div class="square green"></div>
        </div>
        <pre>
    .square:hover {
        background-color: lightgreen;
        transition: background-color 3s;
        transition-delay: 2s;
    }
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation"><b>transition-duration</b></div>
        <div class="explanation">Our square found a friend! The purple square doesn't like the mouse at all, but if the 
            green square warms up to the mouse, then he will too. This transition is taking advantage of the CSS "~" 
            which selects a sibling element, but mostly to demonstrate the two ways to specify the transition duration:
            inline (see .green and .purple) as well as a separate attribute (see .purple:hover).
        </div>
        <div id="demo3" class="demo">
            <div id="greenSquare" class="square green"></div>
            <div id="purpleSquare" class="square purple"></div>
        </div>
        <pre>
    .green {
        background-color: green;
        transition: background-color 1s;
    }
    
    .purple {
        background-color: purple;
        transition: background-color 1s;
    }
    
    .green:hover {
        background-color: lightgreen;
        transition: background-color 3s;
    }

    .purple:hover {
        background-color: red;
        transition: background-color;
        transition-duration: .5s;
    }
    
    .green:hover ~ .purple {
        background-color: lightpink;
        transition: background-color 3s;
    }
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation"><b>transition-property</b></div>
        <div class="explanation">Like the transition duration, the transition-property can be set inline
            with the "transition" attribute or as its own attribute.
        </div>
        <div id="demo4" class="demo">
            <div id="greenSquare4" class="square green"></div>
            <div id="purpleSquare4" class="square purple"></div>
            <div id="orangeSquare4" class="square orange"></div>
        </div>
        <pre>
    .green:hover ~ .orange {
        background-color: red;
        transition-duration: 1s;
        transition-property: background-color;
    }
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation"><b>transition-timing-function</b></div>
        <div class="explanation">The timing function allows you to set almost an animation on the transition.
            There are several different timing functions that can be used, and some of them have to do with 
            steps, but that's where we get more into Animation rather than simply transition, so I'll leave 
            that for a following topic.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">This time, rather than transitioning colors, the squares will demonstrate 
            the different timing functions by growing out. The default timing funciton is "linear", which 
            we have seen already. Although there are several more properties of the timing function, these 
            three are very common, and the rest will be covered in the later topics about transformations and 
            animations.
