        </header>
        <div class="topic-info">Designing, Defining, and Triggering CSS3 Animations without Custom Libraries</div>
        <div class="explanation">If you haven't already, look over the <a href="../transitions/transitions.html">
            Transitions</a> or the <a href="../transformations/transformations.html">Transformations</a> topics, 
            please do so before continuing, since this topic will be utilizing the methods and theories discussed
            in those topics.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Although CSS has its own "animations" attribute, combinations of transitions and 
            transformations also create animations. The biggest difference I'll be demonstrating is the animation's 
            use of keyframes, which can be used with transitions and transformations as well. In fact, the rotating 
            circle in my earlier topics uses animation and keyframes for the path and direction of its movement. 
            Let's take a look at it again.
        </div>
        <div id="demo1" class="demo">
            <div id="circle" class="circle-demo"></div>
        </div>
        <pre>
    .circle-demo {
        border-radius: 50%;
        margin-left: 40%;
        margin-top: 20%;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        position: relative;
        background-color: lightblue;
        border: 1px solid black;
    }
    
    #circle {
        animation-name: orbit;
        animation-duration: 4s;
        animation-timing-function: linear;
        animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    }
    
    .clockwise {
        animation: orbit 4s linear infinite;
    }

    @keyframes orbit {
        from { 	transform: rotate(0deg) translateX(150px) rotate(0deg); }
        to   {  transform: rotate(360deg) translateX(150px) rotate(-360deg); }
    }
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">The styles for the "#circle" element utilize several of the animation attributes.
            Like with transitions and transformations, these attributes can also be set in a single line under the 
            "animation" property, like the styles for ".clockwise" have done. There's a lot 
            going on here that make the animation work. Let's break it down a bit to make it easier to understand.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">The keyframes in the above example are set with the "from" and "to" properties, 
            defining the state of the circle at the beginning and the end of the animation. CSS takes care of the 
            transition on its own. This time, we'll work with percentages so that we can define something new at 
            different points along the animation.
        </div>
        <div id="demo2" class="demo">
            <div class="circle-demo slideColor"></div>
        </div>
        <pre>
    .slideColor {
        animation: slide 8s linear infinite;
    }
    
    @keyframes slide {
        0% { background-color: lightblue; left: 0px; }
        25% { background-color: red; left: 50%; }
        50% { background-color: green; left: 100%; border-radius: 100%; }
        75% { background-color: red; left: 50%; }
        100% { background-color: lightblue; left: 0px; }
    }
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">CSS takes care of the transition automatically, so we only need to declare what happens
            at each point when we want something to have changed. In this case, the animation takes the circle from the 
            left end of its container to the right, and then back. As you can see, not all of the styles have to be 
            declared at every step. Animations in CSS have a few additional properties from transitions and transformations 
            that offer more control over how the animations behave.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Many of these other properties would be better suited for use with another language 
            like JavaScript that could better react to user input or things changing on the DOM, such as the "animation-running"
            property. Animation-running can be set to running or paused, which was demonstrated in one of my earlier topics.
            The "animation-iteration-count" property defines how many times to run through the animation. It can also be set 
            to "infinite" to always continue running the animation. Most animations found on webpages will be in response to
            something the user does. You may already feel like the animation above is getting annoying, a constant movement 
            in your peripheral vision. Having animation in response to user input could offer something like a dropdown menu 
            a nicer, cleaner opening/closing animation. If you host a website about fireworks, maybe put a couple firework 
            animations somewhere on your page where it would make sense but not be overwhelming to your user. Animations 
            can be applied to virtually any element on the DOM, so you can get really creative with it.
