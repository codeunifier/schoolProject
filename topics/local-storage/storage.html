            <h1>Code Topic: Local Storage</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="topic-info">Storing and Retrieving Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects.
            Storing just a simple string will get zero points.</div>
        <div class="explanation">Storage is critical for web pages for a lot of reasons, but
            most things shouldn't be stored where it's easy for people with malicious intent 
            to access. However, there are some things that are really useful for a user if 
            stored on their local machine that wouldn't necessarily need to be stored on the 
            server or in a database.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Exploiting a browser's storage capabilities has usually 
            involved cookies that save sensitive information like passwords or other less 
            sensitive data that might be somewhat costly to query a server for but can be 
            stored locally to save the user time and save the server some processing power.
            This can be anything from HTML data to arrays to simple strings.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Below is a simple example that keeps track of how many times
            you have clicked this button.
        </div>
        <br>
        <button onclick="onButtonClick()">Click me!</button>
        <span id="clicks"></span>
        <div class="explanation">If you open your developer tools and navigate to the Local 
            Storage, you will see the value of this key increase as the button is clicked. This 
            value can be cleared through the dev tools to reset the number.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">This is accomplished in JavaScript through very simple lines 
            of code, as shown below.
        </div>
        <pre>
    if (localStorage.clickCount) {
        localStorage.clickCount++;
    } else {
        localStorage.clickCount = 1;
    }

    document.getElementById("clicks").innerHTML = "Number of clicks: " + localStorage.clickCount;
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">The "localStorage" object is already built into JavaScript, 
            making storing and getting values in local storage dead simple, like any other 
            JavaScript object. This allows us to create and store much more complicated objects 
            in local storage than just a simple number value.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Consider the little shopping cart UI below. Items selected can 
            be saved in local storage for the next time a user comes to the web page. Select a few
            numbers for the items below and click the "Save to Cart" button, then refresh the page 
            to see your selections still there.
        </div>
        <div id="shoppingCart">
            <div class="cart-item"><input id="input_Apples" type="number" min="1" max="10"><span>Apples</span></div>
            <div class="cart-item"><input id="input_Oranges" type="number" min="1" max="10"><span>Oranges</span></div>
            <div class="cart-item"><input id="input_Bananas" type="number" min="1" max="10"><span>Bananas</span></div>
            <div class="cart-item"><input id="input_Kiwi" type="number" min="1" max="10"><span>Kiwi</span></div>
        </div>
        <div id="cartButtons">
            <button onclick="saveSelections()">Save to Cart</button>
            <button onclick="clearShoppingCart()">Clear Selections</button>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">This is done with the following three functions:</div>
        <pre>
        //called when the "Save to Cart" button is clicked
        function saveSelections(item) {
            var elms = document.getElementsByClassName("cart-item");
            var selections = [];
        
            for (var i = 0; i < elms.length; i++) {
                if (elms[i].childNodes[0].value != "") {
                    selections.push({
                        "itemName": elms[i].childNodes[1].innerText,
                        "itemCount": elms[i].childNodes[0].value
                    });
                }
            }
        
            //associative arrays must be stored as stringified objects in local storage
            localStorage.cart = JSON.stringify(selections);
        }
        
        //called when the "Clear Selections" button is clicked
        function clearShoppingCart() {
            var elms = document.getElementsByClassName("cart-item");
        
            for (var i = 0; i < elms.length; i++) {
                elms[i].childNodes[0].value = undefined;
            }
        
            localStorage.removeItem("cart");
        }
        
        //called when the web page loads
        function loadCartItems() {
            if (localStorage.cart) {
                //associative arrays are stored as strings in local storage
                var storageCart = JSON.parse(localStorage.cart);
                
                for (var i = 0; i < storageCart.length; i++) {
                    document.getElementById("input_" + storageCart[i].itemName).value = storageCart[i].itemCount;
                }
            }
        }
        </pre>
        <div class="explanation">Entire HTML files can be stored in local storage using 
            this same method. Opening dev tools will reveal that a demoHTML key also 
            resides in local storage. Deleting this value and refreshing the page will 
            cause an ajax call to be made to retrieve the HTML again, which can also 
            be seen in the Network tab of the developer tools.
        </div>
        <div id="demo">

        </div>
        <div class="explanation">Something to be mindful of when storing HTML code 
            locally on the browser is that changes or updates to that code will only be 
            "updated" on users' browsers when they clear their cache and refresh the page.
            This isn't something people typically do or would ever really realize they
            might have to do, so it's best practice to only store HTML code locally 
            if it likely won't be changing much in the future or you have backend code 
            in place to check for outdated code and update it if necessary.
